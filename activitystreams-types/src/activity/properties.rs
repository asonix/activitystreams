//! Namespace for properties of standard Activity types

//! To use these properties in your own types, you can flatten them into your struct with serde:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate activitystreams_traits;
//! extern crate activitystreams_types;
//! extern crate serde;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate serde_derive;
//!
//! use activitystreams_traits::{Activity, Object};
//! use activitystreams_types::{
//!   activity::properties::ActivityProperties,
//!   object::properties::ObjectProperties,
//! };
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct MyActivity {
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     pub kind: String,
//!
//!     /// Define a require property for the MyActivity type
//!     pub my_property: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
//!     pub object_properties: ObjectProperties,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
//!     pub activity_properties: ActivityProperties,
//! }
//!
//! impl Object for MyActivity {}
//! impl Activity for MyActivity {}
