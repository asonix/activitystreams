//! Activity traits and types

/// An Activity is a subtype of `Object` that describes some form of action that may happen, is
/// currently happening, or has already happened.
///
/// The `Activity` type itself serves as an abstract base type for all types of activities. It is
/// important to note that the `Activity` type itself does not carry any specific semantics about
/// the kind of action being taken.
pub use activitystreams_traits::Activity;

/// Instances of `IntransitiveActivity` are a subtype of `Activity` representing intransitive
/// actions.
///
/// The `object` property is therefore inappropriate for these activities.
pub use activitystreams_traits::IntransitiveActivity;
