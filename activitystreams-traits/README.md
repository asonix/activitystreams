These traits don't provide any functionality other than anotations for types created in other
projects. See the `activitystreams-types` crate for examples of how these traits could be used.

## Examples

```rust
extern crate activitystreams_traits;
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;

use activitystreams_traits::{Object, Actor};

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct Persona {
    #[serde(rename = "type")]
    kind: String,
}

impl Object for Persona {}
impl Actor for Persona {}
```
