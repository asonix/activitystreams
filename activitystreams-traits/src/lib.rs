//! Traits for Activity Streams
//!
//! These traits don't provide any functionality other than anotations for types created in other
//! projects. See the `activitystreams-types` crate for examples of how these traits could be used.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate activitystreams_traits;
//! extern crate serde;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate serde_derive;
//! extern crate serde_json;
//!
//! use activitystreams_traits::{Object, Actor};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct Persona {
//!     #[serde(rename = "@context")]
//!     context: serde_json::Value,
//!
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     kind: String,
//! }
//!
//! impl Object for Persona {}
//! impl Actor for Persona {}
//!
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
