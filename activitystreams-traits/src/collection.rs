/// used to identify a Collection whose items are always ordered. In the JSON serialization, the

/// are represented using the orderedItems property.

/// A `Collection` can contain a large number of items. Often, it becomes impractical for an
/// implementation to serialize every item contained by a `Collection` using the items (or
/// `ordered_items`) property alone. In such cases, the items within a `Collection` can be divided
/// into distinct subsets or "pages". A page is identified using the `CollectionPage` type.
///
/// `UnorderedCollectionPage` and `OrderedCollectionPage` types are provied by the
