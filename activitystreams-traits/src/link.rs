/// A Link is an indirect, qualified reference to a resource identified by a URL.
///
/// The fundamental model for links is established by
/// [[RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)]. Many of the properties defined by the
/// Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of Object or Link. When a Link is
/// used, it establishes a qualified relation connecting the subject (the containing object) to the
/// resource identified by the href. Properties of the Link are properties of the reference as
/// opposed to properties of the resource.
